**Abstract**: This paper addresses a new technique of constrained output feedback robust model predictive control (RMPC) with anti-windup (AW) synthesis adopting linear parameter varying state-space (LPV-SS) systems via relaxed linear matrix inequalities (LMI) procedure. We proposed an output feedback control design with a conservatism reduction, including a robust AW-LPV synthesis to solve the robust stability under saturated signal control mode. Lyapunov stability functions through the LPV emphasis are considered. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, we presented a time response analysis, closed-loop z-plane, worst-case upper bound, and we compared the performance of the proposed method with some MPC benchmarks using a numerical example.
